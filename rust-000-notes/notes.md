# RUST topics
Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, performance, and concurrency. Here are some key topics in Rust, categorized for easier navigation:

## 1.  Basics & Syntax
Variables and mutability (let, let mut)
Data types (primitives, tuples, arrays)
Functions and closures
Control flow (if, match, loop, while, for)
Comments and documentation (//, ///, //!)

## 2. Ownership & Memory Management
Ownership rules (move, copy, borrow)
Borrowing (&T, &mut T)
Lifetimes ('a) and lifetime elision
The String vs &str distinction
Smart pointers (Box<T>, Rc<T>, Arc<T>, RefCell<T>)

## 3. Structs & Enums
Defining structs and methods (impl)
Tuple structs and unit structs
Enums with data (e.g., Option<T>, Result<T, E>)
Pattern matching with match and if let
Deriving traits (#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)])

## 4. Error Handling
Unrecoverable Errors:

Panic (panic!)
Custom panic handlers
Recoverable Errors:

The Result type (Result<T, E>)
The ? operator for error propagation
Custom error types using thiserror or anyhow crates
Error Propagation:

Using ? in functions that return Result or Option
Best Practices:

Matching different error kinds
Converting between error types
Logging & Context:

Adding context to errors (e.g., with .context() from anyhow)
Testing Error Cases:

Writing tests for expected failures
Libraries for Error Handling:

thiserror for library-friendly errors
anyhow for application-friendly errors
Panic vs Result: When to use each approach.

## 5. Generics & Traits
The key concepts in Rust's type system that enable polymorphism.

Generics: Writing code that works with multiple types.
Traits: Defining shared behavior (interfaces).
Trait Bounds: Restricting generics to types that implement certain traits.
Blanket Implementations: Implementing traits for all types that meet criteria.
Associated Types: Specifying placeholder types in traits.
Default Methods: Providing default implementations in traits. 7.trait Objects (&dyn Trait): Dynamic dispatch at runtime.

    trait Greet {
        fn greet(&self) -> String;
    }

    impl Greet for String {
        fn greet(&self) -> String {
            format!("Hello, {}!", self)
        }
    }

    fn print_greet<T: Greet>(item: T) {
        println!("{}", item.greet());
    }

Key Points: • Traits enable zero-cost abstractions. • Most Rust polymorphism is compile-time (via generics), but trait objects allow runtime polymorphism. • Common standard library traits include Debug, Clone, Iterator, From/Into.

## 6. Collections & Iterators
The standard library provides efficient data structures.

1.Vec<T>: Heap-allocated resizable array. 2.String: UTF–8 encoded growable string. 3.HashMap<K,V>/BTreeMap<K,V>: Key-value stores. 4.HashSet<T>/BTreeSet<T>: Unique item collections. 5.LinkedList<T>, VecDeque<T>: Double-ended queues.

Iterators: • Iterator trait is the foundation of Rust's functional-style operations. • Methods like map, filter, fold allow chainable operations. • Collecting into collections with collect().

Example:

    let doubled: Vec<_> = vec![1, 2].into_iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();

Performance Note: Iterators are often optimized as well as hand-written loops!

## 7.Modules & Project Organization
How Rust organizes code at scale.

1.Modules (mod): Namespaces for organizing code within a crate. 2.Pub Visibility: What gets exposed outside the module. 3.Use Declarations: Bringing items into scope. 4.File Structure: • Single file → mod.rs or {module}.rs convention • Directory modules → directory/{mod}.rs

Workspaces: For multi-crate projects managed by one Cargo.toml.

Best Practices: Keep module trees shallow where possible; prefer flat structures over deep nesting.

Documentation: /// for item docs; //! For module-level docs; supports Markdown!

## 8.Cargo & Ecosystem
Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager

Key Features: Dependency management via crates.io or git/private repos Workspaces support multi-crate projects

Common Commands:

cargo new — Create a new project

cargo build — Compile dependencies + project

cargo run — Build + execute binary

cargo test — Run tests including doc-tests

cargo fmt — Autoformat code per style guidelines

Important Files:

Cargo.toml — Metadata + dependencies declaration

Cargo.lock — Exact dependency versions (checked in for binaries)

Common Crates To Know:

serde — Serialization framework

tokio/async-std — Async runtimes

reqwest — HTTP client

clap — Command-line argument parsing

Testing In Rust:

Unit tests go in same file under #[cfg(test)]

Integration tests live in tests/ directory

Doc tests verify code examples in documentation comments

Benchmarking:

#[bench] attribute nightly only currently though alternatives like criterion exist

Publishing Crates To Crates.io Requires Documentation Adherence And Semantic Versioning Awareness

Clippy Is A Linter That Catches Common Mistakes And Style Issues

Rustfmt Ensures Consistent Code Formatting

Cross Compilation Support Exists Via Target Specification

## Advanced Topics
The borrow checker’s rules can be complex but understanding them unlocks safe systems programming

Interior Mutability Patterns Like RefCell Allow Mutable Borrows Checked At Runtime Instead Of Compile Time

Unsafe Rust Allows Bypassing Certain Guarantees For Low Level Control But Requires Careful Manual Verification Of Safety Invariants

FFI Foreign Function Interface Enables Calling Or Being Called From Other Languages Such As C With Zero Cost Abstraction Overhead When Done Correctly

Macros Both Declarative macro_rules And Procedural Macros Extend Language Syntax For Metaprogramming Tasks Without Runtime Cost

Concurrent Programming Is Built On Threads But Also Offers Higher Level Constructors Like Channels Message Passing Via Std Sync Mpsc Or Crossbeam Crates For Multi Producer Single Consumer Queues While Avoiding Data Races Through Type System Guarantees About Thread Safety Traits Send Sync Auto Trait Implementations Help Here Too

Async Await Syntax Provides Another Model For Concurrent Execution Without OS Thread Overhead Using Futures Poll Based State Machines Underneath Which Can Be Executed By Runtime Libraries Like Tokio Or Async Std

Embedded Development Targets Bare Metal Environments With No Standard Library Available Only Core Allocating Collections Requires Alloc Crate Instead While Still Providing Many Safety Features Not Found In Traditional Embedded Languages Such As C Or Assembly

Performance Optimization Relies On Understanding Layout Benchmarks Profiling Tools Like Perf Flamegraph Cachegrind Callgrind Etc Along With Knowledge Of Llvm Optimization Passes That Get Applied During Compilation In Release Mode Profile Guided Optimization Pgo Is Also An Option Where Available

Domain Specific Extensions Include Web Assembly WASM Compilation Targets GPU Compute Via Wgpu RustaCUDA Etc Blockchain Smart Contract Development And More
